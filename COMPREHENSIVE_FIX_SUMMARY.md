## üîß Fixes Implemented

### 1. Unified Chunk Calculation System

**Problem**: The `analyze_chunks.py` script and the actual streaming processor used different termination logic, causing count mismatches.

**Solution**: Created a unified chunk calculation system (`src/utils/chunk_calculator.py`) that provides:
- Single source of truth for chunk calculations
- Consistent algorithm across all components
- Comprehensive chunk analysis and statistics
- Memory and time estimation capabilities

**Key Features**:
- `UnifiedChunkCalculator` class with consistent logic
- `ChunkInfo` dataclass for detailed chunk information
- Memory and processing time estimation
- Factory function for easy integration

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/chunk_calculator.py` (new)
- `scripts/analyze_chunks.py` (updated to use unified calculator)
- `src/core/transcriber.py` (updated to use unified calculator)

### 2. Preprocessing Validation System

**Problem**: No proper validation of preprocessing capabilities before transcription starts.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive preprocessing validation system (`src/utils/preprocessing_validator.py`) that:
- Validates all required and optional dependencies
- Tests actual functionality of preprocessing components
- Provides detailed error messages and recommendations
- Integrates with the main transcriber initialization

**Key Features**:
- `PreprocessingValidator` class with comprehensive validation
- `PreprocessingCapability` and `ValidationResult` dataclasses

- `src/core/transcriber.py` (updated to include validation)

### 3. Enhanced Memory Management System

**Problem**: Poor memory management with inadequate edge case handling.

**Solution**: Created an enhanced memory management system (`src/utils/enhanced_memory_manager.py`) that provides:
- Real-time memory monitoring with adaptive thresholds
- Multiple cleanup strategies (light, medium, heavy, emergency)
- Memory trend analysis and predictive cleanup
- Context managers for memory-intensive operations
- Comprehensive memory reporting

**Key Features**:
- `EnhancedMemoryManager` with adaptive cleanup strategies

- `src/utils/enhanced_memory_manager.py` (new)
- `src/core/transcriber.py` (updated to use enhanced memory manager)

### 4. Architecture Improvements

**Problem**: Missing transcriber attribute and scalability issues.

**Solution**: Fixed architecture issues and improved scalability:
- Fixed missing `transcriber` attribute (renamed to `whisper_transcriber`)
- Added unified chunk calculator integration
- Improved component initialization and validation
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Better separation of concerns

**Key Features**:
- Proper component initialization with validation
- Unified chunk calculator integration
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Memory optimization for operations
- Better component separation and modularity

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/transcriber.py` (comprehensive updates)

### 5. Error Handling and Logging Improvements

**Problem**: Inadequate error handling and logging.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the system:
- Comprehensive exception handling with detailed error messages
- Memory report logging for debugging
- Validation result logging
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Graceful degradation for optional features

**Key Features**:
- Detailed error messages with context
- Memory usage logging for debugging
- Validation result logging with warnings and recommendations
- Progress tracking with chunk information
- Graceful handling of optional features
